We ordered our coil heaters from McMaster-Carr at this [link](https://www.mcmaster.com/coil-heaters/maximum-heat-output~550-f/maximum-heat-output~900-f/maximum-heat-output~1040-f/maximum-heat-output~1200-f/maximum-heat-output~1400-f/maximum-heat-output~1700-f/). We got two 60 inch heaters and one 96 inch heater, such that we have one heater for each heating zone.
