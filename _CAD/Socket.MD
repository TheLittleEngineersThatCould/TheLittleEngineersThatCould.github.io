We bought our socket at Home Depot from the following [link](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-1-2-in-Drive-1-2-in-12-Point-SAE-Deep-Socket-H2D12PDP12/202934328). Initially, we had purchased this following [flexible coupler](https://www.mcmaster.com/6208K687/). However, it was made of 7075 aluminum and we were worried about the strength and stability. We created the socket from scratch in CAD using the measurements we acquired from it.
