## Mission

The Little Engineers That Could are a Vanderbilt senior design team from the class of 2023. Our goal was to improve the sustainability of our engineering practices. We partnered with Vanderbilt recycling to utilize plastic bottle waste from students to supply 3D printing labs across campus with recycled PET filament. Many extruders exist to take pellets of certain types of plastics and produce strands of filament that can be fed into 3D printers. However, what we aimed to do was to design an extruder that was optimized to take ground up plastic bottles and turn them directly into filament. We hoped to use our extruder to create a circular plastics economy at Vanderbilt, where students in years to come can continue to use bottles from Vanderbilt recycling to create filament with satisfactory material properties and supply this filament to various 3D printing labs and makerspaces on campus. Additionally, we hope future students may build on our extruder design to further optimize our process.
