## Mission

The Little Engineers That Could are a Vanderbilt senior design team from the class of 2023. Our goal was to improve the sustainability of our engineering practices. We partnered with Vanderbilt recycling to utilize plastic bottle waste from students to supply 3D printing labs across campus with recycled PET filament. Many extruders exist to take pellets of certain types of plastics and produce strands of filament that can be fed into 3D printers. However, what we aimed to do was to design an extruder that was optimized to take ground up plastic bottles and turn them directly into filament. We hoped to use our extruder to create a circular plastics economy at Vanderbilt, where students in years to come can continue to use bottles from Vanderbilt recycling to create filament with satisfactory material properties and supply this filament to various 3D printing labs and makerspaces on campus. Additionally, we hope future students may build on our extruder design to further optimize our process.

## Mentors

#### Scott Guelcher

![Scott Guelcher Headshot](/assets/img/Guelcher_Headshot-Clear.png){: style="float: left" width="190" height="190"}

Scott Guelcher is a Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Professor of Medicine, and the Director of the Center for Bone Biology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN.  Prior to his appointment at Vanderbilt, he was a Senior Associate Scientist at Bayer Corporation and an NIH/NRSA Fellow in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Professor Guelcher’s research focuses on the design and development of biomaterials and delivery systems that enhance healing of tissue damaged by trauma or disease. He collaborates with biomedical scientists and clinicians to design, develop, and scale-up new materials for bone and soft tissue regeneration from the bench to the bedside.   He also studies how the bone/tumor microenvironment regulates the progression of tumor-induced bone disease and designs new tumor-targeted therapies to block establishment of tumors in bone. Dr. Guelcher is an author on over ninety publications and an inventor on twelve patents. Learn more about Dr. Guelcher [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guelcher-scott-778a8a1b/).

#### David Florian

![David Florian Headshot](/assets/img/David_Headshot-Clear.png){: style="float: left" width="150" height="150"}

David Florian has been a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of Scott Guelcher, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. He received a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from Vanderbilt, and earned a BASc in biomedical engineering from the University of Virginia. His research focuses on modeling and imaging the bone-tumor microenvironment to study the complex process of metastatic seeding and outgrowth of tumor cells in the bone marrow. 

Florian (aka Dr. D-Flo) “is an is an engineer with a passion for teaching and the open-source community.” He created the Dr. D-Flo YouTube channel to share his projects “in hopes of inspiring the next generation of DIYers.” Learn more about Dr. Florian [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-florian-7a2494132/).
