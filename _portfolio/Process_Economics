## Introduction

A key aspect of any proposed process is the economic viability of said process. The benefits of the design must outweigh the costs. In considering the economic feasibility of our prototype extruder, we must consider three aspects: capital investment, production costs, and sales revenue. With these three aspects, we are able to determine the return on investment for our prototype extruder. However, we must also consider the context of our extruder in comparison to a typical, commercially-available filament extruder such as Filabotâ€™s Standard Series EX6 Filament Extruder. Our extruder is economically viable only if the readily available alternatives are not as financially savvy as our prototype. In addition, the standard profitability analysis does not make logical sense in the context of our project. Our extruder is built for students interested in sustainability and prototyping through additive manufacturing; therefore, for the economic analysis of our extruder, we will consider two different cases. In one case, we will simulate running the extruder as if we are retrofitting the Digital Fabrication Lab with our extruder to produce polymer to sell for a profit. In the other case, we will simulate the savings generated when filament is produced on an as-needed basis.

## Capital Investment

Capital investment refers to the cost of the equipment that went into building the prototype extruder. Most analyses of total capital investment are estimates, and analysts go through several different methods of varying degrees of specificity in order to determine the total capital investment. However, for our extruder, we are able to make a definitive estimate because we both designed and built our extruder. Table 1 lists the categories of devices within the extruder along with the actual dollar amount spent on each set of devices. The Motor Train equipment refers to the motor, the gear box, the output shaft, coupler, screw, and die. Electrical equipment refers to the variable frequency drive, the pulse width modulators, the emergency stop button, the power supplies, the wall power connector, and various wiring apparatus. The Heating/Cooling equipment refers to the heating elements, the thermocouples, the temperature PID controllers, and fiberglass insulation. The Machining equipment refers to the taps, lathe attachments, and raw materials used to machine the barrel and flange. 3D Printing Material refers to the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) used to print several components. This cost is negligible due to the low cost of filament and the low mass utilized in fabrication. Finally, the Prototyping Risk cost refers to the costs associated with the team purchasing the wrong items or purchasing too many of a device. For example, the team purchased switches for turning the PIDs on and off, but in our final design, we do not include these switches. This is a risk with any prototyping project. Designs change throughout the process leading to extraneous costs for which we must account.. Since this is the first time this machine has ever been built, changes occur leading to a higher cost than theoretically possible, but in the case of our extruder, the Prototyping Risk cost only amounts to about 7% of the total investment. In addition, this cost disappears for all future projects building this exact extruder due to the availability of the CAD model and full equipment list. This cost is just a reminder that this project is a learning experience for the team and that it is important to include room for error when proposing budgets to future employers.
