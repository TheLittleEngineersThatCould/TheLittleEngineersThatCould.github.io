This amazing learning experience would not have been possible without the help of our mentors and sponsors. We would like to extend our gratitude to the following people and organizations:
*  Scott Guelcher, for his constant support and biweekly meetings to advise us on next steps.
*  David Florian, for his tireless efforts to help us overcome any technical issues we came across in building our extruder
*  Skyler Hornback, for his help with materials testing, making purchases, and general encouragement and guidance
*  The Vanderbilt Immersion Office, for awarding us a $5,000 grant to fund the materials to build our extruder from scratch
*  The Digital Fabrication Lab, for allowing us a space to work, access to machines such as 3D printers and the reclaimer, and spare parts that we needed
*  Vanderbilt Recycling, for sending us shipments of plastic bottles from their recycling line, allowing us to create filament directly out of waste from Vanderbilt students
